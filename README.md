##Form login &amp; Form registration page.

This project was made thinking about how to put both login form and registration form all in one page. After some failed prototypes and a lot of Google research,
the project finally came to life. By builting this page I gained a more deep understanding in things I already studied like how to use RegExp to validate inputs, how to
make a web page responsive by using fluid units in CSS and how to create animations.
